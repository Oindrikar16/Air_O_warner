# Air_O_warner

The project is an implementation of IoT (Internet of Things) Based Air Pollution Monitoring System Using Arduino. Air pollution is a growing issue and it is necessary to monitor air quality for a better future and healthy living for all. IoT is getting popular day-by-day and standards are on its way. Therefore, collection of air quality information is easier. Analysis of monitoring data allows us to assess how bad air pollution from day to day. According to the recent survey, Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh is the third in the list of most air-polluted city. Thus because of this expansion in the quantity of vehicles contamination is developing quickly and it influencing people groups wellbeing too. This air contamination makes disease and harm safe, neurological, regenerative and respiratory framework. In extraordinary cases, it can likewise cause passing. As indicated by overview 50000 to 100000 unexpected losses occurred to us only because of air contamination [2]. Along these lines, there is a requirement for checking air quality and to monitor it. IoT is the system of physical gadgets, vehicles, home apparatuses, and different things implanted with hardware, programming, sensors, and availability which empowers these articles to associate and trade information. IoT permits articles to be noticed or controlled. In this paper, I am proposing and going to piloting a model which IoT to screen air contamination.
